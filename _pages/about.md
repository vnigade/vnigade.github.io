I am a Machine Learning Performance Engineer at eBay, Amsterdam. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [HPDC group](https://www.vuhpdc.net) at VU Amsterdam. <!-- My research focuses on developing high performance and efficient \[networked\] systems for machine learning (ML). -->I received my PhD and MSc *cum laude* from VU Amsterdam. During my PhD, I focused on developing a DL inference serving system for latency-sensitive video analytics applications. This involved designing networked systems that leveraged various modern computing platforms, including end devices, the edge, and the cloud. 

I have around five years of industrial experience in computer systems, specifically in distributed and data storage systems. I am fortunate to have received several awards and recognitions, including [Best ASCI PhD Thesis Award](https://asci.school/) 2023, an [Outstanding Paper Award](https://2022.rtss.org/awards/) atÂ IEEE RTSS 2022, an NVIDIA hardware grant (which includes two A30 GPUs), and a [full two-year scholarship](https://vu.nl/en/education/more-about/incoming-master-vu-scholarships) for my master's degree.
