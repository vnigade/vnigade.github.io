I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the [HPDC group](https://www.vuhpdc.net) at VU Amsterdam, under the guidance of [Prof. Henri Bal](https://www.vuhpdc.net/henri-bal/) and [Prof. Lin Wang](https://linwang.info/) (Paderborn University, Germany). My research focuses on developing efficient \[networked\] systems for machine learning (ML) \[inference\]. Along with this, I am also working on tackling communication challenges in networks of battery-less devices, with an ultimate goal of enabling distributed computation within device clusters (e.g., for running ML inference locally).

During my PhD at VU Amsterdam, I focused on developing a DL inference serving system for latency-sensitive video analytics applications by leveraging the strengths of various modern computing platforms (spanning end devices, the edge, and the cloud). Our paper, [Jellyfish](http://vnigade.github.io/files/jellyfish_rtss22.pdf), received an Outstanding Paper Award at [IEEE RTSS 2022](https://2022.rtss.org/awards/). I also received a hardware grant from NVIDIA, which includes two A30 GPUs.

I received my Master's in Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems [(PDCS)](https://masters.vu.nl/en/programmes/parallel-distributed-computer-systems/index.aspx) from VU Amsterdam with *Cum Laude* honors. I have around five years of industrial experience in computer systems, specifically in distributed and data storage systems.
