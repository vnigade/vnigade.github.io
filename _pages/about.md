I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the [HPDC group](https://www.vuhpdc.net) at VU Amsterdam, under the guidance of [Prof. Henri Bal](https://www.vuhpdc.net/henri-bal/) and [Prof. Lin Wang](https://linwang.info/) (Paderborn University, Germany). My research focuses on developing efficient \[networked\] systems for machine learning (ML) \[inference\], with a growing interest in Tiny and Edge ML—aiming to bring AI into users' hands.

I received my PhD and MSc *cum laude* from VU Amsterdam. During my PhD, I focused on developing a DL inference serving system for latency-sensitive video analytics applications. This involved designing networked systems that leveraged various modern computing platforms, including end devices, the edge, and the cloud. 

I have around five years of industrial experience in computer systems, specifically in distributed and data storage systems. I am fortunate to have received several awards and recognitions, including [Best ASCI PhD Thesis Award](https://asci.school/) 2023, an Outstanding Paper Award at [IEEE RTSS 2022](https://2022.rtss.org/awards/), an NVIDIA hardware grant (which includes two A30 GPUs), and a full two-year [scholarship](https://vu.nl/en/education/more-about/incoming-master-vu-scholarships) for my master's degree.
